    Prompt:

I want a fully functional, risk-managed Forex trading bot written in Python that works with MetaTrader 5 (MT5) using its official MetaTrader5 package. Please include the following features in the script:
✅ Base Trading Logic:

    Trading Platform: MetaTrader 5 (with Python API).

    Symbol: Default to EURUSD (but allow me to change it easily).

    Timeframe: 5-minute chart (M5).

    Indicators for Entry:

        Use Simple Moving Average (SMA) with a 50-period window.

        Use Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a 14-period window.

        Buy Entry: When price > SMA and RSI < 30 (oversold).

        Sell Entry: When price < SMA and RSI > 70 (overbought).

✅ Risk Management:

    Calculate lot size dynamically based on account balance and 1% risk per trade.

    Use fixed Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP) in pips (default SL: 5 pips, TP: 10 pips).

    Enforce a minimum lot size of 0.01.

✅ Safety Controls:

    Run continuously in a loop.

    Check for trades every X minutes (e.g., every 5 minutes — should be adjustable).

    Implement daily loss protection:

        Track total realized losses (in account currency) from closed trades for the current day.

        If total loss exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., $50), pause trading until the next day.

        Reset daily loss counter at a specific hour (default: midnight).

✅ Extras (Optional but Ideal):

    Display logs after each iteration: time, action taken, daily loss, etc.

    Print trade success/failure messages with order ticket or error code.

    Include clear section headers for readability (like # === Trade Execution ===).

    Shutdown MT5 cleanly on exit.

✅ Output Expectation:

A complete Python script that:

    Can be run standalone.

    Requires only MetaTrader5 and pandas installed.

    Uses live MT5 account connection.

    Includes all logic above in a single file.

    Is clean, documented, and beginner-friendly.

    Please include everything in one code block and provide tips or customization notes after the script if needed.

Let me know if you'd like to adapt this to other indicators, longer-term timeframes, or different asset classes (e.g., indices, crypto).
